DOCUMENTATION
Alkalami
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

Older documentation:
The Alkalami-features.idml file illustrates the use of OpenType features 
(source file for original).

The Alkalami-typesample.idml file gives a sample of all the characters in 
the font (source file for original pdf).

pdf files are not distributed now since Indesign does not currently 
support some of the newer Unicode characters that are now in the font.
