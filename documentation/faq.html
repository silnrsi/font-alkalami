    <p>A generic FAQ for all of our Arabic scripts fonts can be found
    here: <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/faq/">Arabic
    Fonts - FAQ</a>. FAQ's specific to Alkalami are found below.</p>
    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-alkalami-come-from"><em>Where does the
    name Alkalami come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Alkǎlami is the local word for the Arabic “qalam”, a type of
    sharpened stick used for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region
    of Nigeria and Niger, and what gives the style its distinct
    appearance.</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-alkalami-pronounced"><em>How is Alkalami
    pronounced?</em></h4>
    <p>The actual spelling of the word is Alkǎlami and it is pronounced
    al-KA-la-mi.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-used-a-previous-version-of-this-font-which-included-a-hacked-encoding.-what-are-the-codepoints-i-should-convert-from-and-to"><em>I
    used a previous version of this font which included a hacked
    encoding. What are the codepoints I should convert from and
    to?</em></h4>
    <p>If you used previous versions of this font, we made some
    decisions which were unfortunately not Unicode compliant. Since the
    initial release of this font, many of these non Unicode compliant
    characters have been added to Unicode. You will need to re-encode
    some characters to be fully Unicode compliant. A chart which
    includes the list of characters is found at the bottom of the <a
    href="features.html">Font Features</a> page.</p>
    <p>These non Unicode compliant solutions were removed in v2.000 of
    the font.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-need-the-alkalami-light-font-and-it-is-not-in-this-package.-where-do-i-find-it"><em>I
    need the Alkalami Light font, and it is not in this package. Where
    do I find it?</em></h4>
    <p>With version 2.000 of <strong>Alkalami</strong>, we have removed
    the <strong>Alkalami Light</strong> font and moved it to its own
    typeface. It is now available as the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/ruwudu">Ruwudu</a> font.</p>
    <h4 id="what-characters-are-included-with-this-release"><em>What
    characters are included with this release?</em></h4>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character Set Support</a> for the full
    listing.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-notice-that-alkalami-is-missing-a-number-of-characters-that-i-would-like.-will-you-add-these"><em>I
    notice that Alkalami is missing a number of characters that I would
    like. Will you add these?</em></h4>
    <p>It is impossible for us to add every glyph that every person
    desires, but we do place a high priority on adding complete coverage
    of all the characters defined in Unicode for this Kano style of
    Arabic script use (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks,
    which are not recommended for normal use). You can send us your
    requests, but please understand that we are unlikely to add symbols
    where the user base is very small, unless they have been accepted
    into Unicode.</p>
    <h4 id="what-is-so-special-about-alkalami"><em>What is so special
    about Alkalami?</em></h4>
    <p>Alkalami is the first attempt at a typeface design based on
    handwritten manuscripts from Nigeria, in a style of writing called
    Rubutun Kano. This font is designed to work with the OpenType
    advanced font technology. To take advantage of the advanced
    typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using
    applications that provide an adequate level of support for OpenType.
    These advanced capabilities provide access to the variant character
    forms used in some languages, as well as a 'smart' font that
    switches out letters to avoid collisions as you type. See <a
    href="features.html">Smart Font Features</a>.</p>
