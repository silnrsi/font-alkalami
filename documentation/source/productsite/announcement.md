#### Known issues

If you used previous versions of this font, we made some decisions which were unfortunately not Unicode compliant. Since the initial release of this font, many of these non Unicode compliant characters have been added to Unicode. You may need to re-encode some characters to be fully Unicode compliant. A chart which includes the list of characters is found at the bottom of the [Font Features](features) page.
