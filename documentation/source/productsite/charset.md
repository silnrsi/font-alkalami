The Alkalami font supports the characters known to be used by languages written with the Kano style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for other languages.

[Arabic (U+0600..U+06FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0600.pdf) was added to Unicode 1.0. [Arabic Supplement (U+0750..U+077F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0750.pdf) was added to Unicode 4.1, [Arabic Extended-A (U+08A0..U+08FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf) was added to Unicode 6.1, and [Arabic Extended-B (U+0870..U+089F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0870.pdf) was added to Unicode 14.0. There are still some Arabic script characters being added to Unicode, so it is possible that not all languages using the Arabic script are fully represented in Unicode.
