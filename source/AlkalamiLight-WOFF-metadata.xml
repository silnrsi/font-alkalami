      Alkalami is the local word for the Arabic "qalam", a type of sharpened stick used
      for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region of Nigeria and in Niger, and what
      gives the style its distinct appearance. The baseline stroke is very thick and
      solid. The ascenders and other vertical strokes including the teeth are very
      narrow when compared to the baseline. A generous line height is necessary to
      allow for deep swashes and descenders, and the overall look of the page is a very
      black, solid rectangle. Diacritics are much smaller in scale, with very little
      distance from the main letters.
      
      This font supports the characters known to be used by languages written with the
      Kano style of Arabic script, but may not have the characters needed for other
      languages.
      
      This font utilizes state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
      typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType only. We have
      no current plans to support Graphite.
      
      Two fonts are included in this release:
      * Alkalami Regular
      * Alkalami Light Regular
